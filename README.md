# BRI3L: A brightness illusion image dataset for identification and localization of regions of illusory perception

Description: This is a dataset of brightness illusion images, containing : 1) Hermann grid, 2) Simultaneous Brightness Contrast, 3) Whiteâ€™s illusion, 4) Grid illusion, and 5) Induced Grating illusion. There are 22,366 illusion images and corresponding ground-truth localization mask.

# Tasks:

We perform the task of illusion detection and localization.

# Illusion detection: 

Fot this task, there are 22,366 illusion images and 1149 non-illusion images. Using data augmentation, we increase the non-illusion images to be 3000, and take 500 images from each of the five class of illusions to perform illusion vs non-illusion detection.

# Illusion localization: 

For this task, we perform illusory patch localization for the dataset.

# Illusion generation:

We also generate illusions using text-to-image and image-to-image diffusion models. For generation, we use the diffusers library. 
The following notebook generates illusions using diffusion models:  illusion_diffusion.ipynb
